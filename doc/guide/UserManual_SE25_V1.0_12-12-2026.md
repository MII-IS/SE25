To ensure users can effectively install, understand, and operate software for controlling a simulated robot, a minimal user manual must cover the complete workflow from setup to execution.

The following structure outlines the minimal essential content required, organized by logical sections.

1. Introduction & System Requirements

Purpose: Briefly explain what the software does (e.g., "simulates 6-DOF robotic arms for path planning").
Prerequisites:
OS Compatibility: (Windows, Linux, macOS).
Hardware Requirements: Minimum RAM, GPU requirements (crucial for 3D rendering), and disk space.
Dependencies: Any external drivers, libraries (e.g., Python, ROS), or frameworks that must be pre-installed.
2. Installation & Setup

Installation Steps: A step-by-step guide to installing the software (from the README?).
First Launch: How to open the application and what to expect (e.g., a splash screen or default empty scene).
3. User Interface (UI) Overview

Layout Diagram: A labeled screenshot of the main workspace.
3D Viewport: Where the robot is visualized.
Control Panel: Where parameters are adjusted.
Toolbar: Buttons for common tools (Select, Move, Rotate).
New control: Make emphasis on the new additions.
4. Setting Up the Simulation Scene

Loading a Robot: How to select a robot model from the library or import a custom model (if possible).
Environment Setup: How to add obstacles, floors, or workpieces to the simulation environment.
Resetting: How to reset the scene or robot to its default "Home" position.
5. Controlling the Robot

Manual Control: Instructions on moving the robot manually.
Program Control:
How to load or write a basic movement script (if possible).
How to run, pause, and stop the execution.
6. Troubleshooting & FAQ

Common Errors: Solutions for frequent issues (e.g., "Simulation runs slowly," "Model fails to load," "Robot is stuck in singularity").
Support: Contact information or links to a community forum/repository for bug reporting.
7. Appendix (Optional but Recommended)

Keyboard Shortcuts: A quick reference list for hotkeys (e.g., Space to Play/Pause, Ctrl+Z to Undo).
Glossary: Definitions of specific terms used.
