# SE25 Documentation

**Project:** SE25 – Robot Simulation and Control System
**Course:** Software Engineering Project (2025–26);
**Responsible:** Documentation Manager – *Elisa Oyaregui (@elisa109)*

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the procedures for creating, naming, organizing, reviewing, maintaining, and disposing of the documentation for the SE25 project. The goal is to ensure **traceability, version control, accessibility, and consistency** across all project documents.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all documentation generated by any team member during the project.

## 3. Document Lifecycle (TBC)

Each document follows the stages below:

* **Creation:** Initial draft following the standard template and naming convention.
  *Responsible:* Document Author.
* **Review:** Peer review by at least one assigned reviewer.
  *Responsible:* Assigned Reviewer (QA Lead or appropriate Lead).
* **Approval:** Final validation by the responsible Lead or Project Manager.
  *Responsible:* Project Manager / Discipline Lead.
* **Release:** The approved version is uploaded to the official repository.
  *Responsible:* Documentation Manager.
* **Maintenance:** Updates and revisions tracked via Git version control. See how changes are managed in XXXXXX. 
  *Responsible:* Author + Documentation Manager. 
* **Archival:** Obsolete versions moved to `/deliverables/archive`.
  *Responsible:* Documentation Manager.
* **Disposal:** Upon project closure, redundant drafts are securely deleted according to the retention policy.
  *Responsible:* Documentation Manager.

## 4. Directory Structure (TBC)

The SE25 repository follows a structured organization to separate code, documentation, and deliverables clearly.  
This ensures consistency, easy navigation, and traceability throughout the software lifecycle. TBC, it could require additional folders inside the mentioned ones. 



```

## 5. Naming Conventions

All documents must follow this naming format:

```
[DocumentType]_[ProjectCode]_[Version]_[YYYY-MM-DD].[ext]
```

**Examples:**
- `SRS_SE25_v1.2_2025-10-15.md`
- `SDD_SE25_v1.0_2025-11-01.pdf`
- `TESTPLAN_SE25_v0.9_2025-11-05.docx`

**Document Type Codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| SRS | System Requirements Specification |
| SDD | System Design Document |
| TESTPLAN | Test Plan |
| TESTREP | Test Report |
| USERMAN | User Manual |
| LOG | Risk / Issue Log |
| PROC | Procedure Document |

**Additional rules:**
- Use lowercase for file extensions (`.md`, `.pdf`, etc.).
- Use `v0.x` for drafts, `v1.0` for the first approved version.
- Dates must use ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Avoid spaces — use underscores `_` instead.

---

## 6. Version Control

All documentation is version-controlled via **GitHub**.

- **Branching:** Drafts and updates are made in separate branches, e.g.  
  `doc/SRS-update-REQ-006`  
  and merged into `develop` after review.
- **Tagging:** Approved versions are tagged using `git tag`, e.g.  
  `v1.0-SRS`.
- **Change Log:** Each document must include a change log at the end listing the version, date, author, and summary of changes.

---

## 7. Review and Approval Process

The review and approval workflow is managed via **GitHub Pull Requests**:

1. The author creates a new branch and a draft PR to `develop`.
2. At least one reviewer (QA Lead or responsible Lead) reviews and comments.
3. The Documentation Manager verifies formatting, naming, and consistency.
4. Once approved, the PR is merged into `develop`.
5. Final releases are merged into `main` and tagged.


## 8. Archiving and Disposal

- Replaced versions are moved to `/deliverables/archive/` and renamed with `_archived_[YYYY-MM-DD]`.
- **Retention policy:** Approved deliverables are retained for a minimum of five years after project completion.
- Drafts or unapproved copies may be deleted after official acceptance.
  
---

## 9. Templates and Automation

All official templates are stored in `deliverables/templates/`:

- `SRS_template.md`
- `SDD_template.md`
- `TestPlan_template.md`
- `MeetingMinutes_template.md`
- `ChangeLog_template.md`

**Recommended GitHub Actions:**
- Validate naming conventions automatically in pull requests.  
- Run Markdown linting (`markdownlint`).  
- Generate automatic changelogs from commit messages.
