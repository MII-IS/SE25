* **Maintenance:** Updates and revisions tracked via Git version control. See how changes are managed in XXXXXX. 
  *Responsible:* Author + Documentation Manager. 
* **Archival:** Obsolete versions moved to `/deliverables/archive`.

## 4. Directory Structure (TBC)

Official documentation is stored under `/deliverables` and `/doc` in the repository. Proposed structure:

```
/se25
├── deliverables/
│   ├── management/        # Plans, reports, and logs
│   ├── requirements/      # SRS, use cases, requirement tables
│   ├── design/            # SDD, diagrams, interface specifications
│   ├── test/              # Test plans, test reports
│   ├── user_docs/         # Manuals and installation guides
│   ├── archive/           # Outdated versions
│   └── templates/         # Standardized templates
└── doc/                   # General documentation and README
```

## 5. Naming Conventions

All documents must follow this naming format:

```
[DocumentType]_[ProjectCode]_[Version]_[YYYY-MM-DD].[ext]
```

**Examples:**

* `SRS_SE25_v1.2_2025-10-15.md`
* `SDD_SE25_v1.0_2025-11-01.pdf`
* `TESTPLAN_SE25_v0.9_2025-11-05.docx`

**Document Type Codes:**

| Code     | Meaning                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| SRS      | System Requirements Specification |
| SDD      | System Design Document            |
| TESTPLAN | Test Plan                         |
| TESTREP  | Test Report                       |
| USERMAN  | User Manual                       |
| LOG      | Risk / Issue Log                  |

**Additional Rules:**

* Use `v0.x` for drafts and `v1.0` for the first approved version.
* Dates must follow the ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

---

## 6. Version Control

**GitHub** is used for both code and document version control.

* **Branching:** Drafts and updates are developed in feature branches (e.g., `doc/SRS-update-REQ-123`) and merged into `develop` after review. Approved versions are merged into `main`.
* **Tagging:** Released versions must be tagged using `git tag` (e.g., `v1.2-SRS`).
* **Change Log:** Each document must include a **Change Log** section listing: date, author, summary of changes, and reviewer.

---

## 7. Format and Style

* **Primary Format:** Markdown (`.md`) for collaborative editing in GitHub.
* **Final Deliverables:** PDF (exported from Markdown) for formal submission.
* **Fonts (PDF):** Roboto or Calibri, 11 pt, line spacing 1.15.
* **Diagrams:** Stored as `.svg` or `.png` in `/images/di
