# Initial Robot Model (Before Enhancement)

This folder contains the original version of the 6-DOF robotic arm model used in the project.  
In this initial design, the robot's base is connected to the world frame through a fixed joint, which means the entire robot remains anchored in place during simulation.

The model supports manual control of the six revolute joints through the Joint State Publisher GUI, allowing users to modify the arm configuration but not its global position.

This version is preserved to document the system's initial structure and to provide a reference for understanding how the model evolved during the enhancement process.
