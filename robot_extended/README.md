# Extended Robot Model (After Enhancement)

This folder contains the enhanced version of the 6-DOF robotic arm model.  
In this improved design, the fixed joint at the robot base has been replaced with a prismatic joint, enabling translation of the base along the X-axis.

This modification introduces a new slider in the Joint State Publisher GUI and allows repositioning of the entire robot within RViz, offering greater flexibility for simulation, testing, and workspace exploration.

The extended model represents the updated system design and serves as the reference implementation for the improved robot behavior.
