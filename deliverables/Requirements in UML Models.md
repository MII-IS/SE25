The tool **Modelio** has been used to represent the requirements in each scenario.


# Developers
This is the diagram corresponding to the requirements that affect the developers. In this case, these are all the established requirements.

Since it is a complex diagram to interpret, detailed information can be obtained by clicking on both the requirements and the scenarios.

# End-User
This is the diagram corresponding to the requirements that affect the **End-User**. This view shows all the operational scenarios and the specific functional and non-functional requirements they satisfy.
